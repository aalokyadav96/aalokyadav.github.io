Windows 8.1, written over the existing source code of Win 7, which sometimes reveals itself unexpectedly, was the last good OS Micrsoft has produced. Later versions are examples of how to not make an OS.

Linux, the programmers' OS, with a fragmented ecosystem of never ending distros. It is great performance wise but very annoying when it comes to User Experience. Though I understand that they are open-source project and UX is not their priority.

<em>Actually we are going to BSDfy but most people know Linux.</em><sup>MacOS is for sheeps who has lots of money and ego issues*</sup>

Now, what if you want to do some magical Linuxy (Read UNIXy) stuff on your Windows OS !
Well, people will suggest using a Virtual Machine. But that takes a lot of time. I will show you how you can execute almost all the Linux commands on you Windows cmd.

## 1. Download MSYS2

## 2. Set Paths

## 3. Download Busybox
